# Expense_Tracker
This is the Expense Tracker that I built for the mini-project of the online course that I was taking.
This Expense Tracker is made using Vanilla Javascript.
This is a simple project where the user enters the amount credited and debited and this helps to keep track of the money spent or secured.
The basic version for the project uses local storage.
